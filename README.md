# An Explainable Transformer-Based Approach for Fake News Detection

## Overview

This project presents an **explainable deep learning framework** for fake news detection using **Transformer-based language models**. In addition to high-accuracy text classification, the system integrates **explainable AI (XAI) techniques** to provide transparent and interpretable insights into model predictions.

The project is developed as a **7th Semester Interim Capstone Project** for the academic year **2025–26**.
